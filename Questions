FIRST REPEATED NON-NEGATIVE NUMBER

Rajeev works in the data center lab of the survey department. He has been assigned the task of identifying "repeated numbers" in a given set of numbers. He approaches you to help him achieve this.

Given an array of numbers, your task is to return the first repeated number in the array starting from the first index.

For example - If input1=(1,2,4,1,2,8) representing the given array, and input2 = 6 representing the number of elements in array, then the result should be I which is the first repeated number in the array.

Special conditions to be taken care:

Note 1: You should ignore the negative numbers and zeros. The program should consider only non-zero, non- negative numbers from the given array.

Note 2: If no number is repeated then the output should be first element of the array.

Note 3: If all elements in the array are negative or O's the output should be 0.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Input Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤100,000 -1,000,000,000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000 (for each element arr[i] in the array)

Output Format:

The program will output a single integer:

The first repeated non-negative number in the array.

If no number is repeated, the output will be the first non-negeve number in the cray.

If all numbers are negative or zero, the output will be 0.

Sample Input:

Sample Output:

1
